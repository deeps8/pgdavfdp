			<p>
				It is incumbent upon all of us to be imbued with the spirit of scientific
				temper. For this we need to constantly imbibe knowledge as also create
				new one; this is especially imperative for all those who ‘educate’ others.
				We need to constantly sharpen the saw and use it to add to the existing
				base of knowledge and learning. Hence the need for this one week long
				Faculty Development Programme (FDP) on Research Methods for
				faculty members from across disciplines in Social Sciences, Humanities,
				and Commerce.
			</p>
			<p>
				The FDP will focus on all the three dimensions of
				research, viz, material, methods, and procedure. It aims at imparting
				methodological insights to participants their equipping them with latest
				tools and techniques. Some of the key areas of the programme
				coverage would be sampling, use of research tools and techniques,
				research writing, IPR, citations, use of open sources, etc. The resource
				persons scheduled for the FDP are being drawn from a wide swathe of
				disciplines to cater to participants from all backgrounds. They have 
				proven expertise in their areas of engagement, and constitute a truly
				eclectic lot. In all more than 15 experts will provide a fulfilling
				experience to the participants. An illustrative, but not exhaustive, and
				randomly chosen list includes luminaries such as Prof. Sanjay Kumar
				(CSDS), Prof. Ujjwal Kumar Singh (University of Delhi), Prof. Vivek Kumar
				(JNU), Prof. Ritesh Singh (Delhi School of Economics), Dr. Narain (FMS,
				DU), and many more.
