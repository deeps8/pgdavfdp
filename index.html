			<p>

			</p>

			<p>
				Every serious student of Business and Economics is cognizant of the dynamic interrelationships between businesses and the various environments in which they operate. Accordingly, they must be equipped with a framework and organizational setting within which such relationships operate. This environment, moreover, is widespread and in a constant state of flux, posing additional challenges to the practitioner and preacher of business operations. Identifying and anticipating customers requirements is impossible unless the organization looks outward to understand its external environment and the implications of changes taking place around it. Then only it can be responsive to the evolving opportunities and threats in the marketplace. At the micro level our initial thoughts pertain to existing and potential markets. The changing tastes and preferences of customers, their disposable incomes, and the price and availability of substitutes seem important as do the size, strength, and number of competitors. But equally, if not more, important are the changes in the broader environment which influence these market conditions. Demographic changes alter the population of various market segments while tax adjustments affect their purchasing power. Cultural and technical developments may exert even more powerful influence on the longer term supply, demands, profitability, and life cycle of different goods.  Rising concern with green environment, gender issues, sustainability, corporate social responsibility, and many more such issues, have caused many businesses to modify their methods of production, product offering, and business practices. In an interconnected world issues like trade wars aint merely curious buzzwords; they hit us on real time basis. Similarly, disruptive innovations like GST change the way business has to be conducted. Macroeconomic numbers and policy pronouncements that are constantly thrown at us by the pink papers, and business news channels baffle us on one hand but, more importantly, challenge us to take stock of them for converting the potential threats into possible profit with no time lost. Nimble and agile are those who constantly monitor, map, and modify business environment to generate profitable businesses. The strategist H.I. Ansoff rightly observed: The firm is a creature of its environment. Its resources, income, problems, opportunities, and the very survival are generated and conditioned by the environment.

			</p>
			<p>
				Societal concerns like sustainable development, gender bias, poverty and inequality, are often translated through the legislative process to impact on the freedom of business to manage. The business leader must always be therefore aware that the environment reflects the pressures from a posse of interested groups to which an appropriate response may be called for. Large firms, especially MNCs, may be able to exert greater influence over their business situation but small firms may have the advantage in responding to the need for change more flexibly.

			</p>
			<p>
				The term Business Environment, encompassing Economics Environment, refers to the totality of all the relevant forces external to, and beyond the control of, an individual business enterprise. These forces, despite being externally located, continue to exercise a significant and meaningful influence on the life and growth patterns of individual enterprise. The present FDP is focused on the study of contemporary business environment as it obtains in India. The main objective is to transform the participants into better creators and disseminators of the latest knowledge and wisdom in this domain.
